**NeuroSurgeryDB** is a preliminary design for a database system designed to store and manage detailed information on patients treated within the Department of Neurosurgery. The schema captures a wide range of data, including:

- Patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, address, contact information)

- Medical history and comorbidities

- Surgical records, including procedure types, dates, outcomes, and complications

- Diagnosis

- Treating surgeon information, including credentials, and specialties

This system supports streamlined clinical documentation, facilitates data-driven audits and research, and enables the efficient retrieval of records for both clinical and academic purposes. The schema is structured to maintain data integrity, support scalability, and ensure compatibility with hospital electronic health record (EHR) systems. Data included is **Synthetic Data** generated using Python.

_Work was performed and evaluated as part of the Tabular Database Systems course & the Design and Development of Databases course during my Medical Informatics Master studies at University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany_
